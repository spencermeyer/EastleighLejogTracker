<h3>Welcome to the Lejog tracker</h3>
<p>The idea is that you track your runs and watch your progress from Land's End to John O Groats.</p>
<p>You can join a team and watch your team's progress.</p>
<h3>Instructions for Strava Alone:</h3>
<p>Enter your strava id in your user field (you can do this by going to edit user from the menu if you didn't do this in the registration).  Then click 'update mileage' and authorise this application to access your Strava data (the link will take you there).  This should automatically import your run data from Stava, and after a minute or so, if you refresh the page, you should see your data appearing in your runs data, and your marker moving along the map.  Don't then enter the same run under 'My Runs' if it has already been imported from Strava, or you'll be double claiming! </p>
<h3>Manual Only Method</h3>
<p>  To make progress without Stava integrationm you'll have to manually enter your runs under 'My Runs'.  :).</p>
